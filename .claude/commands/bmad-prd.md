# Critical Setup

Load configuration from `.bmad/core/config.yaml`
- Output folder: `docs`
- User name: Developer

# Your Task: Create a PRD

Execute the PRD workflow to create a comprehensive Product Requirement Document.

## Step 1: Read Workflow Instructions

Read the workflow instructions:
`.bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/instructions.md`

## Step 2: Read Templates and Resources

Load these resources:
- Template: `.bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/prd-template.md`
- Checklist: `.bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/checklist.md`
- Project types: `.bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/project-types.csv`
- Domain complexity: `.bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/domain-complexity.csv`

## Step 3: Execute the Workflow

Follow the instructions to:
1. Gather project context from the user
2. Identify project type and domain complexity
3. Define Functional Requirements (FRs)
4. Define Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
